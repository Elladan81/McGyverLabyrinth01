Welcome !

This is my first python / pygame test, I hope you enjoy this game!

First, I will create three files in order to make changes more easily without changing the structure of the game as a whole.

My first file will contain the structure of the game.
The second will contain the object classes that make up my game.
The third will contain constants of the game (window configuration, images, sounds,etc.).

There is only one level. 
The structure (departure, location of the walls, arrival), must be recorded in a file for easy modification if necessary.
MacGyver will be controlled by the arrow keys on the keyboard.
Objects will be randomly assigned to the maze and will change locations if the user closes the game and raises.
The game window will be a square that can display 15 sprites along the length.
MacGyver will have to move from box to box, with 15 boxes on the length of the window!
He will retrieve an object simply by moving on it.
The program stops only if MacGyver has recovered all the objects and found the labyrinth output. If he does not have all the objects and he comes to the guard, he dies (life is cruel to the heroes).
The program will be standalone, that is it can be run on any computer.
