"""
classes will be here

this file will contain two classes (atm) :

Level : with two methods, one that generates a level from one file in a structure attribute, the other that displays it on the screen

Character : who creates a character, with a position, an image for each side, a current image (current direction), a position in a box, a position in pixels ...
It contains only one method, that of displacement.
It also recovers the structure of the level, to know the type of each box, and to prevent the displacement if it is a wall.
